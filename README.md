# Helical_Browser_python
This is a Browser Project in which I created a simple browser using PyOt5 and other standard python libraries
The default search engine I used in this Browser is DuckDuckGo
you can easily change the search engine form the main code
All the main code is inside the browser.py file
I also created a .exe file for this browser but I can't upload it over this github repo cause
it does'nt allow the file to be more then 25MB
Github --> 
Try again with a file smaller than 25MB.

## how to create the executable file 
So you can create a .exe file from this code easily by using a python library (Pyinstaller)
just install this module and download this project from this repo and open it in your IDE or code editor 
open the terminal and write -->
Pyinstaller browser.py --onefile
wait for some time & this will create the .exe file and now you can easily share the executable file to anyone.
